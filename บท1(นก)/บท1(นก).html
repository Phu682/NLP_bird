<p>Household names like Echo (Alexa), Siri, and Google Translate have at least one thing in common.
    They are all products derived from the application of natural language processing (NLP), one of the
    two main subject matters of this book. NLP refers to a set of techniques involving the application of
    statistical methods, with or without insights from linguistics, to understand text for the sake of solving
    real-world tasks. This “understanding” of text is mainly derived by transforming texts to useable
    computational representations, which are discrete or continuous combinatorial structures such as
    vectors or tensors, graphs, and trees.</p>

<p>The learning of representations suitable for a task from data (text in this case) is the subject of machine
    learning. The application of machine learning to textual data has more than three decades of history,
    but in the last 10 years a set of machine learning techniques known as deep learning have continued
    to evolve and begun to prove highly effective for various artificial intelligence (AI) tasks in NLP,
    speech, and computer vision. Deep learning is another main subject that we cover; thus, this book is a
    study of NLP and deep learning</p>

<h1>NOTE</h1>
<p>References are listed at the end of each chapter in this book.</p>

<p>Put simply, deep learning enables one to efficiently learn representations from data using an
    abstraction called the computational graph and numerical optimization techniques. Such is the success
    of deep learning and computational graphs that major tech companies such as Google, Facebook, and
    Amazon have published implementations of computational graph frameworks and libraries built on
    them to capture the mindshare of researchers and engineers. In this book, we consider PyTorch, an
    increasingly popular Python-based computational graph framework to implement deep learning
    algorithms. In this chapter, we explain what computational graphs are and our choice of using PyTorch
    as the framework</p>

<p>The field of machine learning and deep learning is vast. In this chapter, and for most of this book, we
    mostly consider what’s called supervised learning; that is, learning with labeled training examples. We
    explain the supervised learning paradigm that will become the foundation for the book. If you are not
    familiar with many of these terms so far, you’re in the right place. This chapter, along with future
    chapters, not only clarifies but also dives deeper into them. If you are already familiar with some of
    the terminology and concepts mentioned here, we still encourage you to follow along, for two reasons:
    to establish a shared vocabulary for rest of the book, and to fill any gaps needed to understand the
    future chapters.</p>

<p>The goals for this chapter are to:</p>
<p>- Develop a clear understanding of the supervised learning paradigm, understand terminology, and
    develop a conceptual framework to approach learning tasks for future chapters</p><hr>





<p>- Learn how to encode inputs for the learning tasks.</p>
<p>- Understand what computational graphs are.</p>
<p>- Master the basics of PyTorch.</p>

<h1>Let’s get started!</h1>
<h1>The Supervised Learning Paradigm</h1>
<p>Supervision in machine learning, or supervised learning, refers to cases where the ground truth for the
    targets (what’s being predicted) is available for the observations. For example, in document
    classification, the target is a categorical label, and the observation is a document. In machine
    translation, the observation is a sentence in one language and the target is a sentence in another
    language. With this understanding of the input data, we illustrate the supervised learning paradigm in
    igure 1-1.</p>

<p>We can break down the supervised learning paradigm, as illustrated in
    igure 1-1, to six mainconcepts:</p>

<p>Observations</p>
    Observations are items about which we want to predict something. We denote observations using
    x. We sometimes refer to the observations as inputs.</p>
<p>Targets</p>
<p>Targets are labels corresponding to an observation. These are usually the things being predicted.
    Following standard notations in machine learning/deep learning, we use y to refer to these.
    Sometimes, these labels known as the ground truth.</p>
<p>Model</p>
<p>A model is a mathematical expression or a function that takes an observation, x, and predicts the
    value of its target label.</p>
<p>Parameters</p>
<p>Sometimes also called weights, these parameterize the model. It is standard to use the notation w
    (for weights) or ŵ.</p>
<p>Predictions</p>
<p>Predictions, also called estimates, are the values of the targets guessed by the model, given the
    observations. We denote these using a “hat” notation. So, the prediction of a target y is denoted as ŷ.</p><hr>





<p>Loss function</p>
<p>A loss function is a function that compares how far off a prediction is from its target for
    observations in the training data. Given a target and its prediction, the loss function assigns a scalar
    real value called the loss. The lower the value of the loss, the better the model is at predicting the
    target. We use L to denote the loss function.</p>
<p>Although it is not strictly necessary to be mathematically formal to be productive in NLP/deep
    learning modeling or to write this book, we will formally restate the supervised learning paradigm to
    equip readers who are new to the area with the standard terminology so that they have some familiarity
    with the notations and style of writing in the research papers they may encounter on arXiv.</p>
<p>Consider a dataset with n examples. Given this dataset, we want to learn a function
    (a model) f parameterized by weights w. That is, we make an assumption about the structure of f, and
    given that structure, the learned values of the weights w will fully characterize the model. For a given
    input X, the model predicts ŷ as the target:</p>
<p>In supervised learning, for training examples, we know the true target y for an observation. The loss
    for this instance will then be L(y, ŷ). Supervised learning then becomes a process of finding the
    optimal parameters/weights w that will minimize the cumulative loss for all the n examples.</p>

<h1>TRAINING USING (STOCHASTIC) GRADIENT DESCENT</h1>
<p>The goal of supervised learning is to pick values of the parameters that minimize the loss function
    for a given dataset. In other words, this is equivalent to finding roots in an equation. We know that
    gradient descent is a common technique to find roots of an equation. Recall that in traditional
    gradient descent, we guess some initial values for the roots (parameters) and update the
    parameters iteratively until the objective function (loss function) evaluates to a value below an
    acceptable threshold (aka convergence criterion). For large datasets, implementation of traditional
    gradient descent over the entire dataset is usually impossible due to memory constraints, and very
    slow due to the computational expense. Instead, an approximation for gradient descent called
    stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is usually employed. In the stochastic case, a data point or a
    subset of data points are picked at random, and the gradient is computed for that subset. When a
    single data point is used, the approach is called pure SGD, and when a subset of (more than one)
    data points are used, we refer to it as minibatch SGD. Often the words “pure” and “minibatch” are
    dropped when the approach being used is clear based on the context. In practice, pure SGD is
    rarely used because it results in very slow convergence due to noisy updates. There are different
    variants of the general SGD algorithm, all aiming for faster convergence. In later chapters, we
    explore some of these variants along with how the gradients are used in updating the parameters.
    This process of iteratively updating the parameters is called backpropagation. Each step (aka
    epoch) of backpropagation consists of a forward pass and a backward pass. The forward pass
    evaluates the inputs with the current values of the parameters and computes the loss function. The
    backward pass updates the parameters using the gradient of the loss</p>

<p>Observe that until now, nothing here is specific to deep learning or neural networks. The directions
    of the arrows in igure 1-1 indicate the “flow” of data while training the system. We will have more to
    say about training and on the concept of “flow” in Computational Graphs”, but first, let’s take a look
    at how we can represent our inputs and targets in NLP problems numerically so that we can train models and predict outcomes.</p><hr>





<h1>Observation and Target Encoding</h1>
<p>We will need to represent the observations (text) numerically to use them in conjunction with machine
    learning algorithms. igure 1-2 presents a visual depiction.</p>
<p>A simple way to represent text is as a numerical vector. There are innumerable ways to perform this
    mapping/representation. In fact, much of this book is dedicated to learning such representations for a
    task from data. However, we begin with some simple count-based representations that are based on
    heuristics. Though simple, they are incredibly powerful as they are and can serve as a starting point for
    richer representation learning. All of these count-based representations start with a vector of fixed
    dimension.</p>

<p>One-Hot Representation</p>
<p>The one-hot representation, as the name suggests, starts with a zero vector, and sets as 1 the
    corresponding entry in the vector if the word is present in the sentence or document. Consider the
    following two sentences:</p>
<p>Tokenizing the sentences, ignoring punctuation, and treating everything as lowercase, will yield a
    vocabulary of size 8: {time, fruit, flies, like, a, an, arrow, banana}. So, we
    can represent each word with an eight-dimensional one-hot vector. In this book, we use 1 to mean
    one-hot representation for a token/word w.</p>
<p>The collapsed one-hot representation for a phrase, sentence, or a document is simply a logical OR of
    the one-hot representations of its constituent words. Using the encoding shown in
    igure 1-3, the onehot representation for the phrase “like a banana” will be a 3×8 matrix, where the columns are the
    eight-dimensional one-hot vectors. It is also common to see a “collapsed” or a binary encoding where
    the text/phrase is represented by a vector the length of the vocabulary, with 0s and 1s to indicate
    absence or presence of a word. The binary encoding for “like a banana” would then be: [0, 0, 0,
    1, 1, 0, 0, 1].</p><hr>





<h1>NOTE</h1>
<p>At this point, if you are cringing that we collapsed the two different meanings (or senses)
    of “flies,” congratulations, astute reader! Language is full of ambiguity, but we can still
    build useful solutions by making horribly simplifying assumptions. It is possible to learn
    sense-specific representations, but we are getting ahead of ourselves now.</p>

<p>Although we will rarely use anything other than a one-hot representation for the inputs in this book,
    we will now introduce the Term-Frequency (TF) and Term-Frequency-Inverse-Document-Frequency
    (TF-IDF) representations. This is done because of their popularity in NLP, for historical reasons, and
    for the sake of completeness. These representations have a long history in information retrieval (IR)
    and are actively used even today in production NLP systems.</p>

<h1>TF Representation</h1>
<p>The TF representation of a phrase, sentence, or document is simply the sum of the one-hot
    representations of its constituent words. To continue with our silly examples, using the aforementioned
    one-hot encoding, the sentence “Fruit flies like time flies a fruit” has the following TF representation:
    [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Notice that each entry is a count of the number of times the
    corresponding word appears in the sentence (corpus). We denote the TF of a word w by TF(w).</p><hr>





<h1>TF-IDF Representation</h1>
<p>Consider a collection of patent documents. You would expect most of them to contain words like
    claim, system, method, procedure, and so on, often repeated multiple times. The TF representation
    weights words proportionally to their frequency. However, common words such as “claim” do not add
    anything to our understanding of a specific patent. Conversely, if a rare word (such as
    “tetrafluoroethylene”) occurs less frequently but is quite likely to be indicative of the nature of the
    patent document, we would want to give it a larger weight in our representation. The InverseDocument-Frequency (IDF) is a heuristic to do exactly that.</p>
<p>The IDF representation penalizes common tokens and rewards rare tokens in the vector representation.
    The IDF(w) of a token w is defined with respect to a corpus as:</p>
<p>where n is the number of documents containing the word w and N is the total number of documents.
    The TF-IDF score is simply the product TF(w) * IDF(w). First, notice how if there is a very common
    word that occurs in all documents (i.e., n = N), IDF(w) is 0 and the TF-IDF score is 0, thereby
    completely penalizing that term. Second, if a term occurs very rarely, perhaps in only one document,
    the IDF will be the maximum possible value, log N. xample 1-2 shows how to generate a TF-IDF
    representation of a list of English sentences using scikit-learn.</p><hr>





<p>In deep learning, it is rare to see inputs encoded using heuristic representations like TF­IDF because
    the goal is to learn a representation. Often, we start with a one­hot encoding using integer indices and
    a special “embedding lookup” layer to construct inputs to the neural network. In later chapters, we
    present several examples of doing this.</p>

<h1>Target Encoding</h1>
<p>As noted in the "The Supervised Learning Paradigm”, the exact nature of the target variable can
    depend on the NLP task being solved. For example, in cases of machine translation, summarization,
    and question answering, the target is also text and is encoded using approaches such as the previously
    described one-hot encoding.</p>
<p>Many NLP tasks actually use categorical labels, wherein the model must predict one of a fixed set of
    labels. A common way to encode this is to use a unique index per label, but this simple representation
    can become problematic when the number of output labels is simply too large. An example of this is
    the language modeling problem, in which the task is to predict the next word, given the words seen in
    the past. The label space is the entire vocabulary of a language, which can easily grow to several
    hundred thousand, including special characters, names, and so on. We revisit this problem in later
    chapters and see how to address it.</p>
<p>Some NLP problems involve predicting a numerical value from a given text. For example, given an
    English essay, we might need to assign a numeric grade or a readability score. Given a restaurant
    review snippet, we might need to predict a numerical star rating up to the first decimal. Given a user’s
    tweets, we might be required to predict the user’s age group. Several approaches exist to encode
    numerical targets, but simply placing the targets into categorical “bins”—for example, “0-18,” “19-25,” “25-30,” and so on—and treating it as an ordinal classification problem is a reasonable approach.
    The binning can be uniform or nonuniform and data-driven. Although a detailed discussion of this
    is beyond the scope of this book, we draw your attention to these issues because target encoding
    affects performance dramatically in such cases, and we encourage you to see Dougherty et al. (1995)
    and the references therein.</p><hr>





<h1>Computational Graphs</h1>
<p>igure 1-1 summarized the supervised learning (training) paradigm as a data flow architecture where
    the inputs are transformed by the model (a mathematical expression) to obtain predictions, and the loss
    function (another expression) to provide a feedback signal to adjust the parameters of the model. This
    data flow can be conveniently implemented using the computational graph data structure.
    Technically, a computational graph is an abstraction that models mathematical expressions. In the
    context of deep learning, the implementations of the computational graph (such as Theano,
    TensorFlow, and PyTorch) do additional bookkeeping to implement automatic differentiation needed
    to obtain gradients of parameters during training in the supervised learning paradigm. We explore this
    further in “PyTorch Basics”. Inference (or prediction) is simply expression evaluation (a forward flow
    on a computational graph). Let’s see how the computational graph models expressions. Consider the
    expression:</p>
<p>This can be written as two subexpressions, z = wx and y = z + b. We can then represent the original
    expression using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which the nodes are the mathematical operations,
    like multiplication and addition. The inputs to the operations are the incoming edges to the nodes and
    the output of each operation is the outgoing edge. So, for the expression y = wx + b, the computational
    graph is as illustrated in igure 1-6. In the following section, we see how PyTorch allows us to create
    computational graphs in a straightforward manner and how it enables us to calculate the gradients
    without concerning ourselves with any bookkeeping.</p>

<h1>PyTorch Basics</h1>
<p>In this book, we extensively use PyTorch for implementing our deep learning models. PyTorch is an
    open source, community-driven deep learning framework. Unlike Theano, Caffe, and TensorFlow,
    PyTorch implements a tape-based utomatic differentiation method that allows us to define and
    execute computational graphs dynamically. This is extremely helpful for debugging and also for
    constructing sophisticated models with minimal effort.</p><hr>





<h1>YNAMIC VERSUS STATIC COMPUTATIONAL GRAPHS</h1>
<p>Static frameworks like Theano, Caffe, and TensorFlow require the computational graph to be first
    declared, compiled, and then executed. Although this leads to extremely efficient
    implementations (useful in production and mobile settings), it can become quite cumbersome
    during research and development. Modern frameworks like Chainer, DyNet, and PyTorch
    implement dynamic computational graphs to allow for a more flexible, imperative style of
    development, without needing to compile the models before every execution. Dynamic
    computational graphs are especially useful in modeling NLP tasks for which each input could
    potentially result in a different graph structure.</p>
<p>PyTorch is an optimized tensor manipulation library that offers an array of packages for deep learning.
    At the core of the library is the tensor, which is a mathematical object holding some multidimensional
    data. A tensor of order zero is just a number, or a scalar. A tensor of order one (1st-order tensor) is an
    array of numbers, or a vector. Similarly, a 2nd-order tensor is an array of vectors, or a matrix.
    Therefore, a tensor can be generalized as an n-dimensional array of scalars, as illustrated in igure 1-7.</p>
<p>In this section, we take our first steps with PyTorch to familiarize you with various PyTorch
    operations. These include:</p>
<p>- Creating tensors</p>
<p>- Operations with tensors</p>
<p>- Indexing, slicing, and joining with tensors</p>
<p>- Computing gradients with tensors</p>
<p>- Using CUDA tensors with GPUs</p>
<p>We recommend that at this point you have a Python 3.5+ notebook ready with PyTorch installed, as
    described next, and that you follow along with the examples. We also recommend working through
    the exercises later in the chapter.</p>

<h1>Installing PyTorch</h1>
<p>The first step is to install PyTorch on your machines by choosing your system preferences at ytorch.org. Choose your operating system and then the package manager (we recommend Conda or
    Pip), followed by the version of Python that you are using (we recommend 3.5+). This will generate
    the command for you to execute to install PyTorch. As of this writing, the install command for the
    Conda environment, for example, is as follows:</p><hr>





<h1>NOTE</h1>
<p>If you have a CUDA­enabled graphics processor unit (GPU), you should also choose the
    appropriate version of CUDA. For additional details, follow the installation instructions on
    ytorch.org</p>

<h1>Creating Tensors</h1>
<p>First, we define a helper function, describe(x), that will summarize various properties of a tensor
    x, such as the type of the tensor, the dimensions of the tensor, and the contents of the tensor:</p>
<p>PyTorch allows us to create tensors in many different ways using the torch package. One way to
    create a tensor is to initialize a random one by specifying its dimensions, as shown in xample 1-3.</p>
<p>We can also create a tensor by randomly initializing it with values from a uniform distribution on the
    interval [0, 1) or the standard normal distribution as illustrated in xample 1-4. Randomly
    initialized tensors, say from the uniform distribution, are important, as you will see in Chapters 3 and 4</p><hr>





<p>We can also create tensors all filled with the same scalar. For creating a tensor of zeros or ones, we
    have built-in functions, and for filling it with specific values, we can use the fill_() method. Any
    PyTorch method with an underscore (_) refers to an in-place operation; that is, it modifies the
    content in place without creating a new object, as shown in xample 1-5.</p><hr>





<p>The values can either come from a list, as in the preceding example, or from a NumPy array. And, of
    course, we can always go from a PyTorch tensor to a NumPy array, as well. Notice that the type of the
    tensor is DoubleTensor instead of the default FloatTensor (see the next section). This
    corresponds with the data type of the NumPy random matrix, a float64, as presented in xample 1</p>
<p>The ability to convert between NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors becomes important when working
    with legacy libraries that use NumPy­formatted numerical values.</p>

<h1>Tensor Types and Size</h1>
<p>Each tensor has an associated type and size. The default tensor type when you use the
    torch.Tensor constructor is torch.FloatTensor. However, you can convert a tensor to a
    different type (float, long, double, etc.) by specifying it at initialization or later using one of the
    typecasting methods. There are two ways to specify the initialization type: either by directly calling
    the constructor of a specific tensor type, such as FloatTensor or LongTensor, or using a special
    method, torch.tensor(), and providing the dtype, as shown in xample 1-8.</p><hr>





<p>We use the shape property and size() method of a tensor object to access the measurements of its
    dimensions. The two ways of accessing these measurements are mostly synonymous. Inspecting the
    shape of the tensor is an indispensable tool in debugging PyTorch code.</p>

<h1>Tensor Operations</h1>
<p>After you have created your tensors, you can operate on them like you would do with traditional
    programming language types, like +, -, *, /. Instead of the operators, you can also use functions like
    .add(), as shown in xample 1-9, that correspond to the symbolic operators.</p><hr>





<p>There are also operations that you can apply to a specific dimension of a tensor. As you might have
    already noticed, for a 2D tensor we represent rows as the dimension 0 and columns as dimension 1, as
    illustrated in xample 1-10.</p><hr>





<p>Often, we need to do more complex operations that involve a combination of indexing, slicing,joining, and mutations. Like NumPy and other numeric libraries, PyTorch has built­in functions to
    make such tensor manipulations very simple.<hr>





<h1>Indexing, Slicing, and Joining</h1>
<p>If you are a NumPy user, PyTorch’s indexing and slicing scheme, shown in xample 1-11, might be very familiar to you.</p>
<p>xample 1-12 demonstrates that PyTorch also has functions for complex indexing and slicing
operations, where you might be interested in accessing noncontiguous locations of a tensor efficiently.</p><hr>





<p>Notice that the indices are a LongTensor; this is a requirement for indexing using PyTorch
    functions. We can also join tensors using built-in concatenation functions, as shown in xample 1-13,
    by specifying the tensors and dimension.</p><hr>





<p>PyTorch also implements highly efficient linear algebra operations on tensors, such as multiplication,
    inverse, and trace, as you can see in xample 1-14.</p><hr>





<p>So far, we have looked at ways to create and manipulate constant PyTorch tensor objects. Just as a
    programming language (such as Python) has variables that encapsulate a piece of data and has
    additional information about that data (like the memory address where it is stored, for example),
    PyTorch tensors handle the bookkeeping needed for building computational graphs for machine
    learning simply by enabling a Boolean flag at instantiation time.</p>

<h1>Tensors and Computational Graphs</h1>
<p>PyTorch tensor class encapsulates the data (the tensor itself) and a range of operations, such as
    algebraic operations, indexing, and reshaping operations. However, as shown in xample 1-15, when
    the requires_grad Boolean flag is set to True on a tensor, bookkeeping operations are enabled
    that can track the gradient at the tensor as well as the gradient function, both of which are needed to
    facilitate the gradient-based learning discussed in “The Supervised Learning Paradigm”.</p><hr>





<p>When you create a tensor with requires_grad=True, you are requiring PyTorch to manage
    bookkeeping information that computes gradients. First, PyTorch will keep track of the values of the
    forward pass. Then, at the end of the computations, a single scalar is used to compute a backward pass.
    The backward pass is initiated by using the backward() method on a tensor resulting from the
    evaluation of a loss function. The backward pass computes a gradient value for a tensor object that
    participated in the forward pass.</p>
<p>In general, the gradient is a value that represents the slope of a function output with respect to the
    function input. In the computational graph setting, gradients exist for each parameter in the model and
    can be thought of as the parameter’s contribution to the error signal. In PyTorch, you can access the
    gradients for the nodes in the computational graph by using the .grad member variable. Optimizers
    use the .grad variable to update the values of the parameters.</p><hr>





<h1>CUDA Tensors</h1>
<p>So far, we have been allocating our tensors on the CPU memory. When doing linear algebra
    operations, it might make sense to utilize a GPU, if you have one. To use a GPU, you need to first
    allocate the tensor on the GPU’s memory. Access to the GPUs is via a specialized API called CUDA.
    The CUDA API was created by NVIDIA and is limited to use on only NVIDIA GPUs. PyTorch
    offers CUDA tensor objects that are indistinguishable in use from the regular CPU-bound tensors
    except for the way they are allocated internally.</p>
<p>PyTorch makes it very easy to create these CUDA tensors, transfering the tensor from the CPU to the
    GPU while maintaining its underlying type. The preferred method in PyTorch is to be device agnostic
    and write code that works whether it’s on the GPU or the CPU. In xample 1-16, we first check
    whether a GPU is available by using torch.cuda.is_available(), and retrieve the device
    name with torch.device(). Then, all future tensors are instantiated and moved to the target
    device by using the .to(device) method.</p>
<p>To operate on CUDA and non­CUDA objects, we need to ensure that they are on the same device. If
    we don’t, the computations will break, as shown in
    xample 1-17. This situation arises when
    computing monitoring metrics that aren’t part of the computational graph, for instance. When
    operating on two tensor objects, make sure they’re both on the same device.</p><hr>





<p>Keep in mind that it is expensive to move data back and forth from the GPU. Therefore, the typical
    procedure involves doing many of the parallelizable computations on the GPU and then transferring
    just the final result back to the CPU. This will allow you to fully utilize the GPUs. If you have several
    CUDA-visible devices (i.e., multiple GPUs), the best practice is to use the
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable when executing the program, as shown here:</p>
<p>We do not cover parallelism and multi­GPU training as a part of this book, but they are essential in
    scaling experiments and sometimes even to train large models. We recommend that you refer to the PyTorch documentation and discussion forums for additional help and support on this topic.</p>

<h1>Exercises</h1>
<p>The best way to master a topic is to solve problems. Here are some warm-up exercises. Many of the
    problems will require going through the official ocumentation and finding helpful functions.

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we introduced the main topics of this book—natural language processing, or NLP, and
    deep learning—and developed a detailed understanding of the supervised learning paradigm. You
    should now be familiar with, or at least aware of, various relevant terms such as observations, targets,
    models, parameters, predictions, loss functions, representations, learning/training, and inference. You
    also saw how to encode inputs (observations and targets) for learning tasks using one-hot encoding,
    and we also examined count-based representations like TF and TF-IDF. We began our journey into
    PyTorch by first exploring what computational graphs are, then considering static versus dynamic
    computational graphs and taking a tour of PyTorch’s tensor manipulation operations. In hapter 2, we
    provide an overview of traditional NLP. These two chapters should lay down the necessary foundation
    for you if you’re new to the book’s subject matter and prepare for you for the rest of the chapters.</p><hr>
